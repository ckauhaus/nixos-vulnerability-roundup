### CVE-2021-40824

A logic error in the room key sharing functionality of Element Android before 1.2.2 and matrix-android-sdk2 (aka Matrix SDK for Android) before 1.2.2 allows a malicious Matrix homeserver present in an encrypted room to steal room encryption keys (via crafted Matrix protocol messages) that were originally sent by affected Matrix clients participating in that room.
