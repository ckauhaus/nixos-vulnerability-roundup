* [ ] [CVE-2021-41991](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41991) CVSSv3=7.5 (nixos-21.05, nixos-unstable)

## CVE details

### CVE-2021-41990

The gmp plugin in strongSwan before 5.9.4 has a remote integer overflow via a crafted certificate with an RSASSA-PSS signature. For example, this can be triggered by an unrelated self-signed CA certificate sent by an initiator. Remote code execution cannot occur.

### CVE-2021-41991

The in-memory certificate cache in strongSwan before 5.9.4 has a remote integer overflow upon receiving many requests with different certificates to fill the cache and later trigger the replacement of cache entries. The code attempts to select a less-often-used cache entry by means of a random number generator, but this is not done correctly. Remote code execution might be a slight possibility.
