This level of information leakage is inconsistent with the standardized onerror/onsuccess disclosure and can lead to inferring login status to services or device discovery on a local network among other attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 80 and Firefox for Android < 80.

### CVE-2020-15682

When a link to an external protocol was clicked, a prompt was presented that allowed the user to choose what application to open it in. An attacker could induce that prompt to be associated with an origin they didn't control, resulting in a spoofing attack. This was fixed by changing external protocol prompts to be tab-modal while also ensuring they could not be incorrectly associated with a different origin. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 82.

### CVE-2020-26955

When a user downloaded a file in Firefox for Android, if a cookie is set, it would have been re-sent during a subsequent file download operation on the same domain, regardless of whether the original and subsequent request were in private and non-private browsing modes. *Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 83.

### CVE-2020-26957

OneCRL was non-functional in the new Firefox for Android due to a missing service initialization.

This vulnerability affects Firefox < 83.

### CVE-2020-26961

When DNS over HTTPS is in use, it intentionally filters RFC1918 and related IP ranges from the responses as these do not make sense coming from a DoH resolver. However when an IPv4 address was mapped through IPv6, these addresses were erroneously let through, leading to a potential DNS Rebinding attack. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 83, Firefox ESR < 78.5, and Thunderbird < 78.5.

### CVE-2020-26965

Some websites have a feature "Show Password" where clicking a button will change a password field into a textbook field, revealing the typed password. If, when using a software keyboard that remembers user input, a user typed their password and used that feature, the type of the password field was changed, resulting in a keyboard layout change and the possibility for the software keyboard to remember the typed password. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 83, Firefox ESR < 78.5, and Thunderbird < 78.5.

### CVE-2020-26966

Searching for a single word from the address bar caused an mDNS request to be sent on the local network searching for a hostname consisting of that string; resulting in an information leak. *Note: This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 83, Firefox ESR < 78.5, and Thunderbird < 78.5.

### CVE-2020-26967

This would lead to internal errors and unexpected behavior in the Screenshots code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 83.

### CVE-2020-26975

When a malicious application installed on the user's device broadcast an Intent to Firefox for Android, arbitrary headers could have been specified, leading to attacks such as abusing ambient authority or session fixation. This was resolved by only allowing certain safe-listed headers. *Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 84.

### CVE-2020-26976

When a HTTPS pages was embedded in a HTTP page, and there was a service worker registered for the former, the service worker could have intercepted the request for the secure page despite the iframe not being a secure context due to the (insecure) framing. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 84.

### CVE-2020-26977

By attempting to connect a website using an unresponsive port, an attacker could have controlled the content of a tab while the URL bar displayed the original domain. *Note: This issue only affects Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 84.

### CVE-2021-23956

An ambiguous file picker design could have confused users who intended to select and upload a single file into uploading a whole directory. This was addressed by adding a new prompt. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 85.

### CVE-2021-23958

The browser could have been confused into transferring a screen sharing state into another tab, which would leak unintended information. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 85.

### CVE-2021-23970

Context-specific code was included in a shared jump table; resulting in assertions being triggered in multithreaded wasm code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 86.

### CVE-2021-23971

When processing a redirect with a conflicting Referrer-Policy, Firefox would have adopted the redirect's Referrer-Policy. This would have potentially resulted in more information than intended by the original origin being provided to the destination of the redirect. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 86.

### CVE-2021-23973

When trying to load a cross-origin resource in an audio/video context a decoding error may have resulted, and the content of that error may have revealed information about the resource. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 86, Thunderbird < 78.8, and Firefox ESR < 78.8.

### CVE-2021-23975

The developer page about:memory has a Measure function for exploring what object types the browser has allocated and their sizes. When this function was invoked we incorrectly called the sizeof function, instead of using the API method that checks for invalid pointers. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 86.

### CVE-2021-23982

Using techniques that built on the slipstream research, a malicious webpage could have scanned both an internal network's hosts as well as services running on the user's local machine utilizing WebRTC connections. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.9, Firefox < 87, and Thunderbird < 78.9.

### CVE-2021-23983

By causing a transition on a parent node by removing a CSS rule, an invalid property for a marker could have been applied, resulting in memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 87.

### CVE-2021-23984

A malicious extension could have opened a popup window lacking an address bar. The title of the popup lacking an address bar should not be fully controllable, but in this situation was. This could have been used to spoof a website and attempt to trick the user into providing credentials. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.9, Firefox < 87, and Thunderbird < 78.9.

### CVE-2021-23985

If an attacker is able to alter specific about:config values (for example malware running on the user's computer), the Devtools remote debugging feature could have been enabled in a way that was unnoticable to the user. This would have allowed a remote attacker (able to make a direct network connection to the victim) to monitor the user's browsing activity and (plaintext) network traffic. This was addressed by providing a visual cue when Devtools has an open network socket. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 87.

### CVE-2021-23986

A malicious extension with the 'search' permission could have installed a new search engine whose favicon referenced a cross-origin URL. The response to this cross-origin request could have been read by the extension, allowing a same-origin policy bypass by the extension, which should not have cross-origin permissions. This cross-origin request was made without cookies, so the sensitive information disclosed by the violation was limited to local-network resources or resources that perform IP-based authentication. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 87.

### CVE-2021-23996

By utilizing 3D CSS in conjunction with Javascript, content could have been rendered outside the webpage's viewport, resulting in a spoofing attack that could have been used for phishing or other attacks on a user. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 88.

### CVE-2021-23998

Through complicated navigations with new windows, an HTTP page could have inherited a secure lock icon from an HTTPS page. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.10, Thunderbird < 78.10, and Firefox < 88.

### CVE-2021-29945

The WebAssembly JIT could miscalculate the size of a return type, which could lead to a null read and result in a crash. *Note: This issue only affected x86-32 platforms. Other platforms are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.10, Thunderbird < 78.10, and Firefox < 88.

### CVE-2021-29951

The Mozilla Maintenance Service granted SERVICE_START access to BUILTIN|Users which, in a domain network, grants normal remote users access to start or stop the service. This could be used to prevent the browser update service from operating (if an attacker spammed the 'Stop' command); but also exposed attack surface in the maintenance service. *Note: This issue only affected Windows operating systems older than Win 10 build 1709. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.10.1, Firefox < 87, and Firefox ESR < 78.10.1.

### CVE-2021-29975

This vulnerability affects Firefox < 90.

### CVE-2021-29982

Due to incorrect JIT optimization, we incorrectly interpreted data from the wrong type of object, resulting in the potential leak of a single bit of memory. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 91 and Thunderbird < 91.

### CVE-2021-29983

Firefox for Android could get stuck in fullscreen mode and not exit it even after normal interactions that should cause it to exit. *Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 91.

### CVE-2021-29987

After requesting multiple permissions, and closing the first permission panel, subsequent permission panels will be displayed in a different position but still record a click in the default location, making it possible to trick a user into accepting a permission they did not want to. *This bug only affects Firefox on Linux. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 91 and Thunderbird < 91.

### CVE-2020-15676

Firefox sometimes ran the onload handler for SVG elements that the DOM sanitizer decided to remove, resulting in JavaScript being executed after pasting attacker-controlled data into a contenteditable element. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 81, Thunderbird < 78.3, and Firefox ESR < 78.3.

### CVE-2020-15677

By exploiting an Open Redirect vulnerability on a website, an attacker could have spoofed the site displayed in the download file dialog to show the original site (the one suffering from the open redirect) rather than the site the file was actually downloaded from. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 81, Thunderbird < 78.3, and Firefox ESR < 78.3.

### CVE-2020-26951

A parsing and event loading mismatch in Firefox's SVG code could have allowed load events to fire, even after sanitization. An attacker already capable of exploiting an XSS vulnerability in privileged internal pages could have used this attack to bypass our built-in sanitizer. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 83, Firefox ESR < 78.5, and Thunderbird < 78.5.

### CVE-2020-26956

In some cases, removing HTML elements during sanitization would keep existing SVG event handlers and therefore lead to XSS. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 83, Firefox ESR < 78.5, and Thunderbird < 78.5.

### CVE-2020-26958

Firefox did not block execution of scripts with incorrect MIME types when the response was intercepted and cached through a ServiceWorker. This could lead to a cross-site script inclusion vulnerability, or a Content Security Policy bypass. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 83, Firefox ESR < 78.5, and Thunderbird < 78.5.

### CVE-2020-26962

Cross-origin iframes that contained a login form could have been recognized by the login autofill service, and populated. This could have been used in clickjacking attacks, as well as be read across partitions in dynamic first party isolation. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 83.

### CVE-2020-26978

Using techniques that built on the slipstream research, a malicious webpage could have exposed both an internal network's hosts as well as services running on the user's local machine. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 84, Thunderbird < 78.6, and Firefox ESR < 78.6.

### CVE-2020-26979

When a user typed a URL in the address bar or the search bar and quickly hit the enter key, a website could sometimes capture that event and then redirect the user before navigation occurred to the desired, entered address. To construct a convincing spoof the attacker would have had to guess what the user was typing, perhaps by suggesting it. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 84.

### CVE-2021-23955

The browser could have been confused into transferring a pointer lock state into another tab, which could have lead to clickjacking attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 85.

### CVE-2021-23959

An XSS bug in internal error pages could have led to various spoofing attacks, including other error pages and the address bar. Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 85.

### CVE-2021-23974

The DOMParser API did not properly process '<noscript>' elements for escaping. This could be used as an mXSS vector to bypass an HTML Sanitizer. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 86.

### CVE-2021-29944

Lack of escaping allowed HTML injection when a webpage was viewed in Reader View. While a Content Security Policy prevents direct code execution, HTML injection is still possible. *Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 88.

### CVE-2021-29953

A malicious webpage could have forced a Firefox for Android user into executing attacker-controlled JavaScript in the context of another domain, resulting in a Universal Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability. *Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected. Further details are being temporarily withheld to allow users an opportunity to update.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 88.0.1 and Firefox for Android < 88.1.3.

### CVE-2020-6829

When performing EC scalar point multiplication, the wNAF point multiplication algorithm was used; which leaked partial information about the nonce used during signature generation. Given an electro-magnetic trace of a few signature generations, the private key could have been computed. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 80 and Firefox for Android < 80.

### CVE-2020-15680

If a valid external protocol handler was referenced in an image tag, the resulting broken image size could be distinguished from a broken image size of a non-existent protocol handler. This allowed an attacker to successfully probe whether an external protocol handler was registered. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 82.

### CVE-2021-23977

Firefox for Android suffered from a time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerability that allowed a malicious application to read sensitive data from application directories. Note: This issue is only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 86.

### CVE-2021-29955

A transient execution vulnerability, named Floating Point Value Injection (FPVI) allowed an attacker to leak arbitrary memory addresses and may have also enabled JIT type confusion attacks. (A related vulnerability, Speculative Code Store Bypass (SCSB), did not affect Firefox.). This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.9 and Firefox < 87.

### CVE-2021-29965

A malicious website that causes an HTTP Authentication dialog to be spawned could trick the built-in password manager to suggest passwords for the currently active website instead of the website that triggered the dialog. *This bug only affects Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 89.

### CVE-2020-12400

When converting coordinates from projective to affine, the modular inversion was not performed in constant time, resulting in a possible timing-based side channel attack. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 80 and Firefox for Android < 80.

### CVE-2020-12401

During ECDSA signature generation, padding applied in the nonce designed to ensure constant-time scalar multiplication was removed, resulting in variable-time execution dependent on secret data. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 80 and Firefox for Android < 80.

### CVE-2020-15665

Firefox did not reset the address bar after the beforeunload dialog was shown if the user chose to remain on the page. This could have resulted in an incorrect URL being shown when used in conjunction with other unexpected browser behaviors. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 80.

### CVE-2020-15668

A lock was missing when accessing a data structure and importing certificate information into the trust database. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 80 and Firefox for Android < 80.

### CVE-2020-16012

Side-channel information leakage in graphics in Google Chrome prior to 87.0.4280.66 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.

### CVE-2020-26953

It was possible to cause the browser to enter fullscreen mode without displaying the security UI; thus making it possible to attempt a phishing attack or otherwise confuse the user. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 83, Firefox ESR < 78.5, and Thunderbird < 78.5.

### CVE-2020-26954

When accepting a malicious intent from other installed apps, Firefox for Android accepted manifests from arbitrary file paths and allowed declaring webapp manifests for other origins. This could be used to gain fullscreen access for UI spoofing and could also lead to cross-origin attacks on targeted websites. *Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 83.

### CVE-2020-26963

Repeated calls to the history and location interfaces could have been used to hang the browser. This was addressed by introducing rate-limiting to these API calls. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 83.

### CVE-2020-35111

When an extension with the proxy permission registered to receive <all_urls>, the proxy.onRequest callback was not triggered for view-source URLs. While web content cannot navigate to such URLs, a user opening View Source could have inadvertently leaked their IP address. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 84, Thunderbird < 78.6, and Firefox ESR < 78.6.

### CVE-2021-23953

If a user clicked into a specifically crafted PDF, the PDF reader could be confused into leaking cross-origin information, when said information is served as chunked data. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 85, Thunderbird < 78.7, and Firefox ESR < 78.7.

### CVE-2021-23963

When sharing geolocation during an active WebRTC share, Firefox could have reset the webRTC sharing state in the user interface, leading to loss of control over the currently granted permission. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 85.

### CVE-2021-23968

If Content Security Policy blocked frame navigation, the full destination of a redirect served in the frame was reported in the violation report; as opposed to the original frame URI. This could be used to leak sensitive information contained in such URIs. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 86, Thunderbird < 78.8, and Firefox ESR < 78.8.

### CVE-2021-23969

As specified in the W3C Content Security Policy draft, when creating a violation report, "User agents need to ensure that the source file is the URL requested by the page, pre-redirects. If that’s not possible, user agents need to strip the URL down to an origin to avoid unintentional leakage." Under certain types of redirects, Firefox incorrectly set the source file to be the destination of the redirects. This was fixed to be the redirect destination's origin. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 86, Thunderbird < 78.8, and Firefox ESR < 78.8.

### CVE-2021-24001

A compromised content process could have performed session history manipulations it should not have been able to due to testing infrastructure that was not restricted to testing-only configurations. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 88.

### CVE-2021-29959

When a user has already allowed a website to access microphone and camera, disabling camera sharing would not fully prevent the website from re-enabling it without an additional prompt. This was only possible if the website kept recording with the microphone until re-enabling the camera. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 89.

### CVE-2021-29960

Firefox used to cache the last filename used for printing a file. When generating a filename for printing, Firefox usually suggests the web page title. The caching and suggestion techniques combined may have lead to the title of a website visited during private browsing mode being stored on disk. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 89.

### CVE-2021-29961

When styling and rendering an oversized `<select>` element, Firefox did not apply correct clipping which allowed an attacker to paint over the user interface. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 89.

### CVE-2021-29962

Firefox for Android would become unstable and hard-to-recover when a website opened too many popups. *This bug only affects Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 89.

### CVE-2021-29963

Address bar search suggestions in private browsing mode were re-using session data from normal mode. *This bug only affects Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 89.

### CVE-2021-29974

When network partitioning was enabled, e.g. as a result of Enhanced Tracking Protection settings, a TLS error page would allow the user to override an error on a domain which had specified HTTP Strict Transport Security (which implies that the error should not be override-able.) This issue did not affect the network connections, and they were correctly upgraded to HTTPS automatically. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 90.

### CVE-2020-15671

When typing in a password under certain conditions, a race may have occured where the InputContext was not being correctly set for the input field, resulting in the typed password being saved to the keyboard dictionary. This vulnerability affects Firefox for Android < 80.

### CVE-2021-24000

A race condition with requestPointerLock() and setTimeout() could have resulted in a user interacting with one tab when they believed they were on a separate tab. In conjunction with certain elements (such as &lt;input type="file"&gt;) this could have led to an attack where a user was confused about the origin of the webpage and potentially disclosed information they did not intend to. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 88.
