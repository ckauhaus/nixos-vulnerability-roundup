## CVE details

### CVE-2021-41801

The ReplaceText extension through 1.41 for MediaWiki has Incorrect Access Control. When a user is blocked after submitting a replace job, the job is still run, even if it may be run at a later time (due to the job queue backlog)

### CVE-2021-41799

### CVE-2021-42040

An issue was discovered in MediaWiki through 1.36.2. A parser function related to loop control allowed for an infinite loop (and php-fpm hang) within the Loops extension because egLoopsCountLimit is mishandled. This could lead to memory exhaustion.

### CVE-2021-41800
