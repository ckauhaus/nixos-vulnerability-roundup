### CVE-2017-2672

A flaw was found in foreman before version 1.15 in the logging of adding and registering images. An attacker with access to the foreman log file would be able to view passwords for provisioned systems in the log file, allowing them to access those systems.

### CVE-2018-1097

A flaw was found in foreman before 1.16.1. The issue allows users with limited permissions for powering oVirt/RHV hosts on and off to discover the username and password used to connect to the compute resource.

### CVE-2021-3494

A smart proxy that provides a restful API to various sub-systems of the Foreman is affected by the flaw which can cause a Man-in-the-Middle attack. The FreeIPA module of Foreman smart proxy does not check the SSL certificate, thus, an unauthenticated attacker can perform actions in FreeIPA if certain conditions are met.
