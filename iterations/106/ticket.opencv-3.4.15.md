## CVE details

### CVE-2019-14493

An issue was discovered in OpenCV before 4.1.1. There is a NULL pointer dereference in the function cv::XMLParser::parse at modules/core/src/persistence.cpp.

### CVE-2019-19624

An out-of-bounds read was discovered in OpenCV before 4.1.1. Specifically, variable coarsest_scale is assumed to be greater than or equal to finest_scale within the calc()/ocl_calc() functions in dis_flow.cpp. However, this is not true when dealing with small images, leading to an out-of-bounds read of the heap-allocated arrays Ux and Uy.

### CVE-2019-15939

An issue was discovered in OpenCV 4.1.0. There is a divide-by-zero error in cv::HOGDescriptor::getDescriptorSize in modules/objdetect/src/hog.cpp.
