## CVE details

### CVE-2021-29981

An issue present in lowering/register allocation could have led to obscure but deterministic register confusion failures in JITted code that would lead to a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 91 and Thunderbird < 91.

### CVE-2021-29982

Due to incorrect JIT optimization, we incorrectly interpreted data from the wrong type of object, resulting in the potential leak of a single bit of memory. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 91 and Thunderbird < 91.

### CVE-2021-29987

After requesting multiple permissions, and closing the first permission panel, subsequent permission panels will be displayed in a different position but still record a click in the default location, making it possible to trick a user into accepting a permission they did not want to. *This bug only affects Firefox on Linux. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 91 and Thunderbird < 91.
