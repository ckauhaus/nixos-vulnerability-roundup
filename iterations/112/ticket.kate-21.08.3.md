* [ ] [CVE-2022-23853](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23853) CVSSv3=7.8 (nixos-21.11)

## CVE details

### CVE-2022-23853

The LSP (Language Server Protocol) plugin in KDE Kate before 21.12.2 and KTextEditor before 5.91.0 tries to execute the associated LSP server binary when opening a file of a given type. If this binary is absent from the PATH, it will try running the LSP server binary in the directory of the file that was just opened (due to a misunderstanding of the QProcess API, that was never intended). This can be an untrusted directory.
