## CVE details

### CVE-2021-3610

A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in ImageMagick in versions prior to 7.0.11-14 in ReadTIFFImage() in coders/tiff.c. This issue is due to an incorrect setting of the pixel array size, which can lead to a crash and segmentation fault.

### CVE-2021-3596

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in ImageMagick in versions prior to 7.0.10-31 in ReadSVGImage() in coders/svg.c. This issue is due to not checking the return value from libxml2's xmlCreatePushParserCtxt() and uses the value directly, which leads to a crash and segmentation fault.
