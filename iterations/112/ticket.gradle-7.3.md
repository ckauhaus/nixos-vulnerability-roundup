* [ ] [CVE-2022-25364](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-25364) CVSSv3=8.1 (nixos-21.11)

## CVE details

### CVE-2022-25364

In Gradle Enterprise before 2021.4.2, the default built-in build cache configuration allowed anonymous write access. If this was not manually changed, a malicious actor with network access to the build cache could potentially populate it with manipulated entries that execute malicious code as part of a build. As of 2021.4.2, the built-in build cache is inaccessible-by-default, requiring explicit configuration of its access-control settings before it can be used. (Remote build cache nodes are unaffected as they are inaccessible-by-default.)
