## CVE details

### CVE-2022-25366

Cryptomator through 1.6.5 allows DYLIB injection because, although it has the flag 0x1000 for Hardened Runtime, it has the com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation and com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables entitlements. An attacker can exploit this by creating a malicious .dylib file that can be executed via the DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES environment variable.
