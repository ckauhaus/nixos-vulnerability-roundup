## CVE details

### CVE-2021-43794

Discourse is an open source discussion platform. In affected versions an attacker can poison the cache for anonymous (i.e. not logged in) users, such that the users are shown a JSON blob instead of the HTML page. This can lead to a partial denial-of-service. This issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions of Discourse.

### CVE-2021-43792

Discourse is an open source discussion platform. In affected versions a vulnerability affects users of tag groups who use the "Tags are visible only to the following groups" feature. A tag group may only allow a certain group (e.g. staff) to view certain tags. Users who were tracking or watching the tags via /preferences/tags, then have their staff status revoked will still see notifications related to the tag, but will not see the tag on each topic. This issue has been patched in stable version 2.7.11. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.

### CVE-2021-43793

Discourse is an open source discussion platform. In affected versions a vulnerability in the Polls feature allowed users to vote multiple times in a single-option poll. The problem is patched in the latest tests-passed, beta and stable versions of Discourse
