## CVE details

### CVE-2019-11644

In the F-Secure installer in F-Secure SAFE for Windows before 17.6, F-Secure Internet Security before 17.6, F-Secure Anti-Virus before 17.6, F-Secure Client Security Standard and Premium before 14.10, F-Secure PSB Workstation Security before 12.01, and F-Secure Computer Protection Standard and Premium before 19.3, a local user can escalate their privileges through a DLL hijacking attack against the installer. The installer writes the file rm.exe to C:\Windows\Temp and then executes it. The rm.exe process then attempts to load several DLLs from its current directory. Non-admin users are able to write to this folder, so an attacker can create a malicious C:\Windows\Temp\OLEACC.dll file. When an admin runs the installer, rm.exe will execute the attacker's DLL in an elevated security context.
