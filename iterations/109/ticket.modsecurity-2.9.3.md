* [ ] [CVE-2021-42717](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-42717) CVSSv3=7.5 (nixos-21.05, nixos-21.11, nixos-unstable)

## CVE details

### CVE-2021-42717

ModSecurity 3.x through 3.0.5 mishandles excessively nested JSON objects. Crafted JSON objects with nesting tens-of-thousands deep could result in the web server being unable to service legitimate requests. Even a moderately large (e.g., 300KB) HTTP request can occupy one of the limited NGINX worker processes for minutes and consume almost all of the available CPU on the machine. Modsecurity 2 is similarly vulnerable: the affected versions include 2.8.0 through 2.9.4.
