## CVE details

### CVE-2021-36126

An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension in MediaWiki through 1.36. If the MediaWiki:Abusefilter-blocker message is invalid within the content language, the filter user falls back to the English version, but that English version could also be invalid on a wiki. This would result in a fatal error, and potentially fail to block or restrict a potentially nefarious user.

### CVE-2021-36128

An issue was discovered in the CentralAuth extension in MediaWiki through 1.36. Autoblocks for CentralAuth-issued suppression blocks are not properly implemented.

### CVE-2021-36132

An issue was discovered in the FileImporter extension in MediaWiki through 1.36. For certain relaxed configurations of the $wgFileImporterRequiredRight variable, it might not validate all appropriate user rights, thus allowing a user with insufficient rights to perform operations (specifically file uploads) that they should not be allowed to perform.

### CVE-2021-35197

In MediaWiki before 1.31.15, 1.32.x through 1.35.x before 1.35.3, and 1.36.x before 1.36.1, bots have certain unintended API access. When a bot account has a "sitewide block" applied, it is able to still "purge" pages through the MediaWiki Action API (which a "sitewide block" should have prevented).

### CVE-2021-36125

An issue was discovered in the CentralAuth extension in MediaWiki through 1.36. The Special:GlobalRenameRequest page is vulnerable to infinite loops and denial of service attacks when a user's current username is beyond an arbitrary maximum configuration value (MaxNameChars).

### CVE-2021-36130

An XSS issue was discovered in the SocialProfile extension in MediaWiki through 1.36. Within several gift-related special pages, a privileged user with the awardmanage right could inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript within various gift-related data fields. The attack could easily propagate across many pages for many users.

### CVE-2021-36131

An XSS issue was discovered in the SportsTeams extension in MediaWiki through 1.36. Within several special pages, a privileged user could inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript within various data fields. The attack could easily propagate across many pages for many users.

### CVE-2021-36127

An issue was discovered in the CentralAuth extension in MediaWiki through 1.36. The Special:GlobalUserRights page provided search results which, for a suppressed MediaWiki user, were different than for any other user, thus easily disclosing suppressed accounts (which are supposed to be completely hidden).

### CVE-2021-36129

An issue was discovered in the Translate extension in MediaWiki through 1.36. The Aggregategroups Action API module does not validate the parameter for aggregategroup when action=remove is set, thus allowing users with the translate-manage right to silently delete various groups' metadata.
