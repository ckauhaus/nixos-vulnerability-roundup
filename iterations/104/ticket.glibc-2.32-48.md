## CVE details

### CVE-2021-33574

The mq_notify function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc) versions 2.32 and 2.33 has a use-after-free. It may use the notification thread attributes object (passed through its struct sigevent parameter) after it has been freed by the caller, leading to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly unspecified other impact.

### CVE-2021-27645

The nameserver caching daemon (nscd) in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.29 through 2.33, when processing a request for netgroup lookup, may crash due to a double-free, potentially resulting in degraded service or Denial of Service on the local system. This is related to netgroupcache.c.
