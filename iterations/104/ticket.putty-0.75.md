* [ ] [CVE-2021-36367](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-36367) CVSSv3=8.1 (nixos-21.05)

## CVE details

### CVE-2021-36367

PuTTY through 0.75 proceeds with establishing an SSH session even if it has never sent a substantive authentication response. This makes it easier for an attacker-controlled SSH server to present a later spoofed authentication prompt (that the attacker can use to capture credential data, and use that data for purposes that are undesired by the client user).
