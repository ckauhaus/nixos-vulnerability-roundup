### CVE-2021-22230

Improper code rendering while rendering merge requests could be exploited to submit malicious code. This vulnerability affects GitLab CE/EE 9.3 and later through 13.11.6, 13.12.6, and 14.0.2.

### CVE-2021-22224

A cross-site request forgery vulnerability in the GraphQL API in GitLab since version 13.12 and before versions 13.12.6 and 14.0.2 allowed an attacker to call mutations as the victim

Under certain conditions, some users were able to push to protected branches that were restricted to deploy keys in GitLab CE/EE since version 13.9

### CVE-2021-22228

An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions. Improper access control allows unauthorised users to access project details using Graphql.

### CVE-2021-22223

Client-Side code injection through Feature Flag name in GitLab CE/EE starting with 11.9 allows a specially crafted feature flag name to PUT requests on behalf of other users via clicking on a link

### CVE-2021-22227

A reflected cross-site script vulnerability in GitLab before versions 13.11.6, 13.12.6 and 14.0.2 allowed an attacker to send a malicious link to a victim and trigger actions on their behalf if they clicked it

### CVE-2021-22225

Insufficient input sanitization in markdown in GitLab version 13.11 and up allows an attacker to exploit a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability via a specially-crafted markdown

### CVE-2021-22232

HTML injection was possible via the full name field before versions 13.11.6, 13.12.6, and 14.0.2 in GitLab CE

### CVE-2021-22231

### CVE-2021-32823

In the bindata RubyGem before version 2.4.10 there is a potential denial-of-service vulnerability. In affected versions it is very slow for certain classes in BinData to be created. For example BinData::Bit100000, BinData::Bit100001, BinData::Bit100002, BinData::Bit<N>. In combination with <user_input>.constantize there is a potential for a CPU-based DoS. In version 2.4.10 bindata improved the creation time of Bits and Integers.
