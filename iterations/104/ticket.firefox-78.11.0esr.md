## CVE details

### CVE-2021-23994

A WebGL framebuffer was not initialized early enough, resulting in memory corruption and an out of bound write. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.10, Thunderbird < 78.10, and Firefox < 88.

### CVE-2021-23995

When Responsive Design Mode was enabled, it used references to objects that were previously freed. We presume that with enough effort this could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.10, Thunderbird < 78.10, and Firefox < 88.

### CVE-2021-23997

Due to unexpected data type conversions, a use-after-free could have occurred when interacting with the font cache. We presume that with enough effort this could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 88.

### CVE-2021-23999

If a Blob URL was loaded through some unusual user interaction, it could have been loaded by the System Principal and granted additional privileges that should not be granted to web content. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.10, Thunderbird < 78.10, and Firefox < 88.

### CVE-2021-24002

When a user clicked on an FTP URL containing encoded newline characters (%0A and %0D), the newlines would have been interpreted as such and allowed arbitrary commands to be sent to the FTP server. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.10, Thunderbird < 78.10, and Firefox < 88.

### CVE-2021-29946

Ports that were written as an integer overflow above the bounds of a 16-bit integer could have bypassed port blocking restrictions when used in the Alt-Svc header. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.10, Thunderbird < 78.10, and Firefox < 88.

### CVE-2021-29947

Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 87. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 88.

### CVE-2021-29966

Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 88. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 89.

### CVE-2021-29967

Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 88 and Firefox ESR 78.11. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.11, Firefox < 89, and Firefox ESR < 78.11.

### CVE-2021-29968

When drawing text onto a canvas with WebRender disabled, an out of bounds read could occur. *This bug only affects Firefox on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 89.0.1.

### CVE-2021-29952

When Web Render components were destructed, a race condition could have caused undefined behavior, and we presume that with enough effort may have been exploitable to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 88.0.1 and Firefox for Android < 88.1.3.

### CVE-2021-29964

A locally-installed hostile program could send `WM_COPYDATA` messages that Firefox would process incorrectly, leading to an out-of-bounds read. *This bug only affects Firefox on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.11, Firefox < 89, and Firefox ESR < 78.11.

### CVE-2021-23996

By utilizing 3D CSS in conjunction with Javascript, content could have been rendered outside the webpage's viewport, resulting in a spoofing attack that could have been used for phishing or other attacks on a user. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 88.

### CVE-2021-23998

Through complicated navigations with new windows, an HTTP page could have inherited a secure lock icon from an HTTPS page. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.10, Thunderbird < 78.10, and Firefox < 88.

### CVE-2021-29945

The WebAssembly JIT could miscalculate the size of a return type, which could lead to a null read and result in a crash. *Note: This issue only affected x86-32 platforms. Other platforms are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.10, Thunderbird < 78.10, and Firefox < 88.

### CVE-2021-29951

The Mozilla Maintenance Service granted SERVICE_START access to BUILTIN|Users which, in a domain network, grants normal remote users access to start or stop the service. This could be used to prevent the browser update service from operating (if an attacker spammed the 'Stop' command); but also exposed attack surface in the maintenance service. *Note: This issue only affected Windows operating systems older than Win 10 build 1709. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.10.1, Firefox < 87, and Firefox ESR < 78.10.1.

### CVE-2021-29944

Lack of escaping allowed HTML injection when a webpage was viewed in Reader View. While a Content Security Policy prevents direct code execution, HTML injection is still possible. *Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 88.

### CVE-2021-29953

A malicious webpage could have forced a Firefox for Android user into executing attacker-controlled JavaScript in the context of another domain, resulting in a Universal Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability. *Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected. Further details are being temporarily withheld to allow users an opportunity to update.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 88.0.1 and Firefox for Android < 88.1.3.

### CVE-2021-29955

A transient execution vulnerability, named Floating Point Value Injection (FPVI) allowed an attacker to leak arbitrary memory addresses and may have also enabled JIT type confusion attacks. (A related vulnerability, Speculative Code Store Bypass (SCSB), did not affect Firefox.). This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.9 and Firefox < 87.

### CVE-2021-29965

A malicious website that causes an HTTP Authentication dialog to be spawned could trick the built-in password manager to suggest passwords for the currently active website instead of the website that triggered the dialog. *This bug only affects Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 89.

### CVE-2021-24001

A compromised content process could have performed session history manipulations it should not have been able to due to testing infrastructure that was not restricted to testing-only configurations. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 88.

### CVE-2021-29959

When a user has already allowed a website to access microphone and camera, disabling camera sharing would not fully prevent the website from re-enabling it without an additional prompt. This was only possible if the website kept recording with the microphone until re-enabling the camera. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 89.

### CVE-2021-29960

Firefox used to cache the last filename used for printing a file. When generating a filename for printing, Firefox usually suggests the web page title. The caching and suggestion techniques combined may have lead to the title of a website visited during private browsing mode being stored on disk. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 89.

### CVE-2021-29961

When styling and rendering an oversized `<select>` element, Firefox did not apply correct clipping which allowed an attacker to paint over the user interface. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 89.

### CVE-2021-29962

Firefox for Android would become unstable and hard-to-recover when a website opened too many popups. *This bug only affects Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 89.

### CVE-2021-29963

Address bar search suggestions in private browsing mode were re-using session data from normal mode. *This bug only affects Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 89.

### CVE-2021-24000

A race condition with requestPointerLock() and setTimeout() could have resulted in a user interacting with one tab when they believed they were on a separate tab. In conjunction with certain elements (such as &lt;input type="file"&gt;) this could have led to an attack where a user was confused about the origin of the webpage and potentially disclosed information they did not intend to. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 88.
