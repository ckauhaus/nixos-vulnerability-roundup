* [ ] [CVE-2021-35942](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-35942) CVSSv3=9.1 (nixos-21.05)

## CVE details

### CVE-2021-35942

The wordexp function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc) through 2.33 may crash or read arbitrary memory in parse_param (in posix/wordexp.c) when called with an untrusted, crafted pattern, potentially resulting in a denial of service or disclosure of information. This occurs because atoi was used but strtoul should have been used to ensure correct calculations.
