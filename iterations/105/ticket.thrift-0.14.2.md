This issue affects Facebook Thrift prior to v2019.02.18.00.

### CVE-2019-3553

C++ Facebook Thrift servers would not error upon receiving messages declaring containers of sizes larger than the payload. As a result, malicious clients could send short messages which would result in a large memory allocation, potentially leading to denial of service. This issue affects Facebook Thrift prior to v2020.02.03.00.

### CVE-2019-3558

Python Facebook Thrift servers would not error upon receiving messages with containers of fields of unknown type.
