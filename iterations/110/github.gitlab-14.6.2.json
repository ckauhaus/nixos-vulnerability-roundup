In affected versions it is very slow for certain classes in BinData to be created. For example BinData::Bit100000, BinData::Bit100001, BinData::Bit100002, BinData::Bit<N>. In combination with <user_input>.constantize there is a potential for a CPU-based DoS. In version 2.4.10 bindata improved the creation time of Bits and Integers."
