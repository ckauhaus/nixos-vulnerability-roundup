* [ ] [CVE-2021-43858](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43858) CVSSv3=8.8 (nixos-21.11)

## CVE details

### CVE-2021-43858

MinIO is a Kubernetes native application for cloud storage. Prior to version `RELEASE.2021-12-27T07-23-18Z`, a malicious client can hand-craft an HTTP API call that allows for updating policy for a user and gaining higher privileges. The patch in version `RELEASE.2021-12-27T07-23-18Z` changes the accepted request body type and removes the ability to apply policy changes through this API. There is a workaround for this vulnerability: Changing passwords can be disabled by adding an explicit `Deny` rule to disable the API for users.
