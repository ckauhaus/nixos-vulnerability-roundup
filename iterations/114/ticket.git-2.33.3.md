## CVE details

### CVE-2022-24765

Git for Windows is a fork of Git containing Windows-specific patches. This vulnerability affects users working on multi-user machines, where untrusted parties have write access to the same hard disk. Those untrusted parties could create the folder `C:\.git`, which would be picked up by Git operations run supposedly outside a repository while searching for a Git directory. Git would then respect any config in said Git directory. Git Bash users who set `GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE` are vulnerable as well. Users who installed posh-gitare vulnerable simply by starting a PowerShell. Users of IDEs such as Visual Studio are vulnerable: simply creating a new project would already read and respect the config specified in `C:\.git\config`. Users of the Microsoft fork of Git are vulnerable simply by starting a Git Bash. The problem has been patched in Git for Windows v2.35.2. Users unable to upgrade may create the folder `.git` on all drives where Git commands are run, and remove read/write access from those folders as a workaround. Alternatively, define or extend `GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES` to cover the _parent_ directory of the user profile, e.g. `C:\Users` if the user profile is located in `C:\Users\my-user-name`.

### CVE-2021-46101

In Git for windows through 2.34.1 when using git pull to update the local warehouse, git.cmd can be run directly.

### CVE-2022-24975

The --mirror documentation for Git through 2.35.1 does not mention the availability of deleted content, aka the "GitBleed" issue. This could present a security risk if information-disclosure auditing processes rely on a clone operation without the --mirror option.

### CVE-2018-1000182

A server-side request forgery vulnerability exists in Jenkins Git Plugin 3.9.0 and older in AssemblaWeb.java, GitBlitRepositoryBrowser.java, Gitiles.java, TFS2013GitRepositoryBrowser.java, ViewGitWeb.java that allows attackers with Overall/Read access to cause Jenkins to send a GET request to a specified URL.

### CVE-2021-21684

Jenkins Git Plugin 4.8.2 and earlier does not escape the Git SHA-1 checksum parameters provided to commit notifications when displaying them in a build cause, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

### CVE-2020-2136

Jenkins Git Plugin 4.2.0 and earlier does not escape the error message for the repository URL for Microsoft TFS field form validation, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability.

### CVE-2018-1000110

An improper authorization vulnerability exists in Jenkins Git Plugin version 3.7.0 and earlier in GitStatus.java that allows an attacker with network access to obtain a list of nodes and users.

### CVE-2019-1003010

A cross-site request forgery vulnerability exists in Jenkins Git Plugin 3.9.1 and earlier in src/main/java/hudson/plugins/git/GitTagAction.java that allows attackers to create a Git tag in a workspace and attach corresponding metadata to a build record.
