## CVE details

### CVE-2020-36316

In RELIC before 2021-04-03, there is a buffer overflow in PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification because garbage bytes can be present.

### CVE-2020-36315

In RELIC before 2020-08-01, RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature forgery can occur because certain checks of the padding (and of the first two bytes) are inadequate. NOTE: this requires that a low public exponent (such as 3) is being used. The product, by default, does not generate RSA keys with such a low number.
