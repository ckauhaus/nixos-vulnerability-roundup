## CVE details

### CVE-2019-9185

Controller/Async/FilesystemManager.php in the filemanager in Bolt before 3.6.5 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code by renaming a previously uploaded file to have a .php extension.

### CVE-2021-27367

Controller/Backend/FileEditController.php and Controller/Backend/FilemanagerController.php in Bolt before 4.1.13 allow Directory Traversal.

### CVE-2019-15483

Bolt before 3.6.10 has XSS via a title that is mishandled in the system log.

### CVE-2019-15484

Bolt before 3.6.10 has XSS via an image's alt or title field.

### CVE-2019-15485

Bolt before 3.6.10 has XSS via createFolder or createFile in Controller/Async/FilesystemManager.php.

### CVE-2020-4041

In Bolt CMS before version 3.7.1, the filename of uploaded files was vulnerable to stored XSS. It is not possible to inject javascript code in the file name when creating/uploading the file. But, once created/uploaded, it can be renamed to inject the payload in it. Additionally, the measures to prevent renaming the file to disallowed filename extensions could be circumvented. This is fixed in Bolt 3.7.1.

### CVE-2017-16754

Bolt before 3.3.6 does not properly restrict access to _profiler routes, related to EventListener/ProfilerListener.php and Provider/EventListenerServiceProvider.php.

### CVE-2020-28925

Bolt before 3.7.2 does not restrict filter options in a Request in the Twig context, and is therefore inconsistent with the "How to Harden Your PHP for Better Security" guidance.

### CVE-2020-4040

Bolt CMS before version 3.7.1 lacked CSRF protection in the preview generating endpoint. Previews are intended to be generated by the admins, developers, chief-editors, and editors, who are authorized to create content in the application. But due to lack of proper CSRF protection, unauthorized users could generate a preview. This has been fixed in Bolt 3.7.1
