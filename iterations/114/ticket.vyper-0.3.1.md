## CVE details

### CVE-2022-24788

Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual machine. Versions of vyper prior to 0.3.2 suffer from a potential buffer overrun. Importing a function from a JSON interface which returns `bytes` generates bytecode which does not clamp bytes length, potentially resulting in a buffer overrun. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

### CVE-2022-24845

Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual machine. In affected versions, the return of `<iface>.returns_int128()` is not validated to fall within the bounds of `int128`. This issue can result in a misinterpretation of the integer value and lead to incorrect behavior. As of v0.3.0, `<iface>.returns_int128()` is validated in simple expressions, but not complex expressions. Users are advised to upgrade. There is no known workaround for this issue.
