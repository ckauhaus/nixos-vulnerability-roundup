## CVE details

### CVE-2022-29046

Jenkins Subversion Plugin 2.15.3 and earlier does not escape the name and description of List Subversion tags (and more) parameters on views displaying parameters, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.

### CVE-2021-28544

Apache Subversion SVN authz protected copyfrom paths regression Subversion servers reveal 'copyfrom' paths that should be hidden according to configured path-based authorization (authz) rules. When a node has been copied from a protected location, users with access to the copy can see the 'copyfrom' path of the original. This also reveals the fact that the node was copied. Only the 'copyfrom' path is revealed; not its contents. Both httpd and svnserve servers are vulnerable.

### CVE-2022-29048

A cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Jenkins Subversion Plugin 2.15.3 and earlier allows attackers to connect to an attacker-specified URL.
