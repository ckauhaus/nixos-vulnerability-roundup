## CVE details

### CVE-2021-44458

Linux users running Lens 5.2.6 and earlier could be compromised by visiting a malicious website. The malicious website could make websocket connections from the victim's browser to Lens and so operate the local terminal feature. This would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands as the Lens user.

### CVE-2021-23154

In Lens prior to 5.3.4, custom helm chart configuration creates helm commands from string concatenation of provided arguments which are then executed in the user's shell. Arguments can be provided which cause arbitrary shell commands to run on the system.
