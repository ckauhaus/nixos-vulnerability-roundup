## CVE details

### CVE-2022-23218

The deprecated compatibility function svcunix_create in the sunrpc module of the GNU C Library (aka glibc) through 2.34 copies its path argument on the stack without validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow, potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application is not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.

### CVE-2022-23219

The deprecated compatibility function clnt_create in the sunrpc module of the GNU C Library (aka glibc) through 2.34 copies its hostname argument on the stack without validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow, potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application is not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.

### CVE-2021-38604

In librt in the GNU C Library (aka glibc) through 2.34, sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/mq_notify.c mishandles certain NOTIFY_REMOVED data, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. NOTE: this vulnerability was introduced as a side effect of the CVE-2021-33574 fix.
