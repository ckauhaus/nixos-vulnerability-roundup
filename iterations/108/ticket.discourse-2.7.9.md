## CVE details

### CVE-2021-41082

Discourse is a platform for community discussion. In affected versions any private message that includes a group had its title and participating user exposed to users that do not have access to the private messages. However, access control for the private messages was not compromised as users were not able to view the posts in the leaked private message despite seeing it in their inbox. The problematic commit was reverted around 32 minutes after it was made. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest commit if they are running Discourse against the `tests-passed` branch.

### CVE-2021-41271

Discourse is a platform for community discussion. In affected versions a maliciously crafted request could cause an error response to be cached by intermediate proxies. This could cause a loss of confidentiality for some content. This issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions of Discourse.
