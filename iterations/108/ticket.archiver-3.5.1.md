* [ ] [CVE-2019-10743](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10743) CVSSv3=5.5 (nixos-unstable)

## CVE details

### CVE-2019-10743

All versions of archiver allow attacker to perform a Zip Slip attack via the "unarchive" functions. It is exploited using a specially crafted zip archive, that holds path traversal filenames. When exploited, a filename in a malicious archive is concatenated to the target extraction directory, which results in the final path ending up outside of the target folder. For instance, a zip may hold a file with a "../../file.exe" location and thus break out of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.
