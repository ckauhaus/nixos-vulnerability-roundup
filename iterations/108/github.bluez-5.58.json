        "description": "BlueZ is a Bluetooth protocol stack for Linux. In affected versions a vulnerability exists in sdp_cstate_alloc_buf which allocates memory which will always be hung in the singly linked list of cstates and will not be freed. This will cause a memory leak over time. The data can be a very large object, which can be caused by an attacker continuously sending sdp packets and this may cause the service of the target device to crash."
