## CVE details

### CVE-2021-21698

Jenkins Subversion Plugin 2.15.0 and earlier does not restrict the name of a file when looking up a subversion key file on the controller from an agent.

### CVE-2017-1000085

Subversion Plugin connects to a user-specified Subversion repository as part of form validation (e.g. to retrieve a list of tags). This functionality improperly checked permissions, allowing any user with Item/Build permission (but not Item/Configure) to connect to any web server or Subversion server and send credentials with a known ID, thereby possibly capturing them. Additionally, this functionality did not require POST requests be used, thereby allowing the above to be performed without direct access to Jenkins via Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.

### CVE-2020-2304

Jenkins Subversion Plugin 2.13.1 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

### CVE-2020-2111

Jenkins Subversion Plugin 2.13.0 and earlier does not escape the error message for the Project Repository Base URL field form validation, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability.

### CVE-2018-1000111

An improper authorization vulnerability exists in Jenkins Subversion Plugin version 2.10.2 and earlier in SubversionStatus.java and SubversionRepositoryStatus.java that allows an attacker with network access to obtain a list of nodes and users.
