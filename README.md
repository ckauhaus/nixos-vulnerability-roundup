# nixos-vulnerability-roundup

Scripts and whitelists for the weekly NixOS vulnerability roundups.

## Pre-run checklist

* Check out [nixpkgs-channels](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs-channels).
* Make sure that the branches you want to scan exist.
* Build *vulnix* and the *survey* tool: `nix-build default.nix` (note that it
  needs Rust >= 1.30 which is currently only in nixos-unstable).

## Usage

Create iteration N covering branches BRANCH1 and BRANCH2:

```sh
result/bin/survey -v result/bin/vulnix -n /path/to/nixpkgs-channels \
  N BRANCH1 BRANCH2
```

Submit created tickets (files in `iterations/N`) to
https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues.
