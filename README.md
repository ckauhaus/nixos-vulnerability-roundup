# nixos-vulnerability-roundup
Scripts and whitelists for the weekly NixOS vulnerability roundups

## Pre-run checklist

* Check out [nixpkgs-channels](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs-channels).
* Make sure that the branches you want to scan exist.
* Build the `survey` tool: `(cd survey && cargo build --release)`
* Have a running version of `vulnix` somewhere

## Usage

Create iteration N covering branches BRANCH1 and BRANCH2:

```sh
./survey/target/release/survey -v /path/to/vulnix -n /path/to/nixpkgs-channels \
  N BRANCH1 BRANCH2
```

Submit created tickets (files in ./iterations/N) to GitHub.
